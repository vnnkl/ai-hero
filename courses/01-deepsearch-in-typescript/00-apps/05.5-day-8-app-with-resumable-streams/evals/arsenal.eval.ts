          Emile Smith Rowe was also sold to Fulham in 2024 for £27 million.
          He is playing regularly for Fulham - 35 games this season with 5 goals.
          Aaron Ramsdale was sold to Southampton in 2024 for £18m.
          He is playing regularly - 25 games this season, though Southampton are
          performing poorly which reflects badly on a goalkeeper.

          Overall, Emile Smith Rowe is probably performing the best.

          Kai Havertz was also injured, and his injury was very impactful.
          Bukayo Saka has been injured for less time than Kai Havertz, but
          since he is a better player than Havertz, his injury has impacted
          Arsenal's performance more.
          Gabriel Magalhaes was also injured recently, but Jakob Kiwior has
          deputised well.
          Gabriel Jesus was also injured, and was out for a long time. His absence
          led to Mikel Merino (a defensive midfielder by trade) playing up front.

          They had some unfortunate red cards at the beginning of the season,
          and it's arguable this hurt their momentum.
          However, the injuries were the most impactful reason.
          Many felt that since Manchester City dropped off in the 2024/25 season,
          Arsenal were the best team remaining and should have won the league.
          However, Liverpool ended up winning the league.
          At the time of writing, the league is not finished - but Liverpool
          are many points clear of Arsenal.

          start of games, and would have scored 63 points if the table did not include
          the second half of games.

          However, they are worse in the second half of games. They would have scored
          54 points in the second half of games, compared to 63 in the first half.
